# React Testing Library Jest

- As a developer, our primary goal is to build software that works
- To ensure our software works, we test the application
- We check if our software works as expected.

## Manual Testing

- An individual will open the website, interact with the website and ensure everything works as intended.
- If a new feature is released, you repeat the same steps.
- You may have to test not only the new features but also the existing features.

#### Drawbacks

- Time Consuming
- Complex repetitive tasks has a risk of human error
- You may not get a chance to test all the features you should

## Automated Testing

- Automated tests are program that automates the task of testing your software
- Write code to test the software code
- Additional effort required when you develop a feature
